| Name | Description | Libraries |
| :---         |     :---     |          ---: |
|  [P1: Data Preprocessing](Yandex/P1_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb) | Prepare a report for a bank’s loan division  | pandas, nltk   |
| [P2: Exploratory Data Analysis](Yandex/P2_EDA.ipynb)  | Determine the market value of real estate properties and define the parameters  that make it possible to create an automated system capable of detecting anomalies and fraud| pandas, matplotlib.pyplot  |
|  [P3: Statistical Data Analysis](Yandex/P3_Statistical_Data_Analysis.ipynb) | Carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection| pandas, nltk   |
|  [P4: Data Storage SQL](Yandex/P1_Data_storage_SQL.ipynb) | Find patterns in the available information. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.  | pandas, numpy  |
|  [P5: Introduction to Machine Learning](Yandex/P1_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb) | Develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra| pandas, sklearn/metric,ensemble, linear, model_selection/ |
|  [P6: Supervised Learning](Yandex/P6_Supervised_Learning.ipynb) | Predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon. You have the data on clients’ past behavior and termination of contracts with the bank.  | pandas, nltk   |
|  [P7: Machine Learning for Business](Yandex/P7_Machine_Learning_for_Business.ipynb) |  Task is to find the best place for a new well. Parameters of each oil well in the region are already known. Build a model that will help to pick the region with the highest profit margin  | pandas, sklearn/tree/linear_model/ensemble/preprocessing  |
|  [P8: Linear Algebra](Yandex/P8_Linear_Algebra.ipynb) | Develop a data transforming algorithm that would make it hard to recover personal information from the transformed data.The data should be protected in such a way that the quality of machine learning models doesn't suffer | pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn.model_selection|
|  [P9: Numericalc Methods](Yandex/P9_Numerical_Methods.ipynb) | Build a model to get: the quality of the prediction, the speed of the prediction, the time required for training | pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn.model_selection, xgboost, lightgbm|
|  [P10: Time Series](Yandex/P10_Time_Series.ipynb) | To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour. Build a model for such a prediction | pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn/model_selection/pipeline, statsmodels/tsa.stattools/tsa.seasonal|
|  [P11: Machine Learning for Texts](Yandex/P11_Machine_Learning_for_Texts.ipynb) |The goal is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. You'll be using a dataset of IMBD movie reviews with polarity labelling to build a model for classifying positive and negative reviews | pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn/model_selection/dummy, nltk/corpus/tokenize|
|  [P12: Computer Vision](Yandex/P12_Computer_Vision.ipynb) | Photofixation in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers. We should determine the age through the photso and then analyze the purchases may interest them| pandas, numpy,tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image/layers/model/optimizers|
